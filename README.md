## Elevator Pitch
When “Restaurant goers” can’t decide what they want to eat, Grubbr can help them swipe through restaurants nearby or in searched cities with your friends. The user will be able to add friends that have common restaurants and start chatting or set up a date!

## User Stories
The User: Anyone who likes to go to restaurants, especially people who like to try new restaurants and also needs a date, either a friend or a romantic one.
Well, have you ever been with a partner/friend and you get into an argument because you both cant figure out what to eat? Grubbr can help people make friends based on the same types of restaurants they like.
